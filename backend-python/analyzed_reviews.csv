This is a great set. Looks very cool all lit up and works great too. The mouse is easy to use and the mouse pad is a decent size too. The headphones work great. The keyboard is nice and i love how it lights up so can use at night. No issues with any of the set. Great price for so many things.,0.9996265172958374,LABEL_3

My 15 year old grandson loved it!  Is telling all his friends about it.  Only thing he has trouble with is he needs to get some kind of an adapter for the headset.  He has a laptop not a tower and he can't use the headset yet.  But it does work as I have the tower.  Thank you for the great low price.  Debbie Brown,0.9520871043205261,LABEL_2
"Well worth the money for sure! My son loved it! It comes with the light up, crack/lightening effect keyboard and mouse (mouse can alternate lights between 3 different colors), came with a mousepad and headset with mic. You can‚Äôt beat the quality of this product for the price!!! Definitely recommend!",0.9993757605552673,LABEL_3

"When I first bought this product, I only used the headset eventually and haven't used the microphone attached to it.  Sound is ok in the headset, although more expensive headsets would give you a better base, like the legacy or logitech kinds.I still have not used the mouse...it's still in the original box but I'm not getting my hopes up about the quality and that's because of the quality of the keyboard, which I just decided to use today...as I write this review.This keyboard is the most plastic feeling keyboard I have ever typed with and the buttons feel kind of strange and flimsy.  Some of the buttons look a little more depressed than other buttons but maybe that's just my eyes.The lighting is cool but the problem with that is, when the lighting fails to lightup, you won't be able to see anything on the keyboard and you know the thing is going to stop lighting up in the future.  I would have rather the keyboard just have normal white print on the keys.Even now, typing this review, I find myself hitting the backspace or spacebar more because a space failed to input or a keystroke failed to input.  You really have to stroke your keys with this keyboard and because of that, you can't get really relaxed like you would a good keyboard and just let your fingers feather flow.You gotta act like your fingers have little bricks tied to them if you're going to type without hitting backspace too much on this thing.So, like I said, I don't expect too much from the mouse given how the keyboad feels and I can not speak for the microphone on the headset because I haven't used it yet but again...  The sound from the headset is ok...not the best headset sound I've ever experienced but for the money, you wouldn't argue too much.I am disapointed in the feel of this keyboard.  I feel like I'm fighting with it as I type this.I can't really speak for a gaming stand point because I don't think you really need a special keyboard, mouse, etc for gaming, you just need quality hardware.  It does have a nice ""gaming look"" tho.",0.5318116545677185,LABEL_0
"The headset isn‚Äôt bad. It‚Äôs comfortable and the sound is excellent. The only issue is the microphone on it. Due to it being short and far from your face it doesn‚Äôt always pick you up and sounds muffled when you do. In order to pick up decent voice I had to change some settings to make the mic more sensitive thus making everything in the room be heard. Still a good headset though.Keyboard look pretty sick, but it seems like it‚Äôs made pretty cheap. They keys are unique as well, some slightly variated in place as compared to a regular keyboard. One thing that bothered me because I‚Äôm OCD (but isn‚Äôt really an issue) is that everything is red on the keyboard so why is there a little blue box near the caps light? I don‚Äôt know why that bothered me so much! HahaThe mouse is great. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with the mouse at all as I had a similar one for my old gaming laptop. Also, it‚Äôs not only red lights. I think it has blue and purple too.Overall, this is for sure the thing to get if your looking to get a lot of red lights to match a red computer and not break the bank on brand name stuff. I would recommend this to someone who is a gamer and likes red, but if you plan on streaming or recording you should also invest in a microphone due to the headset sound.",0.6973721385002136,LABEL_2
Bought this for my 12 year old for Christmas. He loves it. The keyboard is comfortable for him and the mouse and mouse pad are nice quality. The headset wasn‚Äôt the best quality but it gets the job done.,0.9966501593589783,LABEL_2
Bought this for my nephew who is just getting into PC gaming. I will have to say BlueFinger surprised me with this bundle. Don't get me wrong not the best quality headphones buuuut descent. The mouse felt great in my hand and i have large bear palms. The keyboard reaction time is great. Can't complain for the price this is perfect for an entry level gamer ...looking to experience the online community and compete. Would recommend to anyone looking to save a buck.,0.6956020593643188,LABEL_2

"Works as advertised, no troubles. The mouse light pulses instead of steady. You can make it steady but then the mouse scroll wheel is disabled and its dimly lit. This isnt a deal breaker but you should be aware of it.",0.9600164294242859,LABEL_2
awesome deal. headphones are loud abd at top volume can be heard clearly from others surroinding but that is not anbig deal. only wish is that the shipping boxes were better and the quality of the boxes they were shipped in. also have the mouse the same color as the keyboard. great job blue finger,0.7186078429222107,LABEL_2

"Unfortunately I have to put a negative review cause after a couple of weeks the headset stopped working and when I wanted to do a return or refund I find out I first have to pay out of my own pocket to return the headset before the return/refund. Honestly it's not worth it so we having to buy new headsets from somewhere else ü•∫ The mouse is great the keyboard is very nice to use as you have to press the keys very deep, makes it awkward to use.",0.9998950958251953,LABEL_0
This is the most uncomfortable headset I‚Äôve ever owned in my life. Less than an hour of gaming and my ears are hurting. Had to buy a new headset.I understand this it‚Äôs cheap but dollar store headphones are more comfortable than these.Sorry for the bad review but it‚Äôs my honest opinion people shouldn‚Äôt buy this product. You can save $10 on a combo without the headset and buy one separate.,0.9995606541633606,LABEL_0
the mouse pad and key board are to my liking but the headset I found to be very uncomfortable after a short time of wearing. The mouse broke on me with in a week of use. for the price though its understandable. the headset does work well enough to use if its all you can afford though,0.9087672829627991,LABEL_1

"Honestly, I had high hopes for this product. I was excited about the color change. I even gave it a good while before writing this review so I could really give an honest review. This keyboard is not that great. It does the job: typing. As far as that, the #6 is not lit up like the rest of the key board. The right shift key is SO hard to use that you practically have to slam down hard on it just to get it to engage. The headset is almost a joke. I work online and when I have meetings, I am always met with complaints about how much background noise there is. I'm in my basement, silenced away from any noises. I started recording my meetings so that I could hear what they were talking about and it's bad. It's a constant HUM in the background. I also have noticed that you sound distant when talking, probably due to the microphone being a good 3 to 4 inches away from your face. The sound in the headset is very finicky. The headset will sometimes work with both headphones, the next it will only work with one. You have to play around with the cable to get the headset sound to reappear, only for it to disappear again shortly after. The only good thing about this purchase was the mouse. It is a really silent clicker, so I am able to do research while in meetings without disturbing the other person talking. I hate talking bad about a company and their products, but for the price I paid, I surely expect it to come in working order. No the headset does not change colors, it is a permanent red the entire time. OH and the mousepad is HUGE compared to many other pads I've had. It's about the size of a piece of printer paper. If I could, I'd get a refund or perhaps never even buy this product.",0.9318307638168335,LABEL_0
This keyboard worked great for a few months them the RGB light would just turn itself off. When this happens I would have to disconnect the keyboard and reconnect it.  Finally had enough of that yesterday after it did it 8 or 9 time while I was working and just got a new different one.  The mouse work great still and never had an issue.,0.7678379416465759,LABEL_3
I ordered this for my sons birthday. This says works with the PS4. The keyboard and mouse are great. The headphones however do not work with the system. It has 2 seperate plugs. A plug in for voice and seperate one for sound which the PS4 does not have a spot for both. My son loved the keyboard and mouse. They light up great and work well. I didn't send it back because my son wanted to keep the mouse and keyboard. I will have to order different headphones which is upsetting because the set really went well together.,0.868602991104126,LABEL_0
"Honestly the only big problem I had with this bundle is the headset. The sound quality isn't really good but that wasn't my biggest issue. I couldn't seem to get the mic to work on my PC, not to mention I got it for my ps4 and didn't realize I needed an adapter to use the mic with it. The mouse and keyboard are great, keyboard came a bit dirty but wasn't too bad and doesn't hinder performance. Wouldn't mind keeping those and just returning the headset for one of equal value.",0.6578286290168762,LABEL_1

"I got this as an inexpensive keyboard and mouse of a PC I was building for my sons birthday.  The first thing I did was slice my hand open on part of the plastic molding on the keyboard.  Once I got past that, I checked out the stuff that came in the box.  It is cheap.  It feels cheap, it sounds cheap, it works cheaply. I could not even bring myself to use it as we build his machine, it was that bad.  The mouse would work, on its own time.  The keyboard is light and the E and S keys did not work.  I  missed the return window so now I have to figure out what to do with this piece of plastic that is useless and will only fill a landfill.I would look elsewhere for even a cheap mouse/keyboard set.  The earphones on the headset worked, the mic did not and it is not a comfortable headset at all.",0.9998887777328491,LABEL_0

"the whole keyboard broke in about less than a month. Some keys stopped working. The worst quality especially if it is easily broken. The mouse has also become unsensitive, in order to click I have to press super hard. I don‚Äôt recommend this product. Even though it‚Äôs cheap for the bundle, I would recommend getting better quality even if it costs a few more bucks. Overall this keyboard is really bad if it broke that easily. Sadly it stopped working a just a few days after the return option which sucks because I spent 50+ dollars on something that broke in a month or less. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!",0.9998787641525269,LABEL_0
"I'm actually genuinely disappointed with this, and I wish I could leave 0 stars.  Every single piece of this bundle was garbage.  For starters, the keyboard arrived with the right shift key permanently depressed, so I wouldn't have been able to type with it.  The mouse would click, then any additional clicks would highlight everything from where I clicked last rather than moving the cursor.  The headset was tinny and distant, and the microphone was so short that it didn't reach my face to speak into it, so it didn't pick up a single thing that I said. But hey, at least it LOOKED cool.",0.9996955394744873,LABEL_0
