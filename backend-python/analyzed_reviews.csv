This is a great set. Looks very cool all lit up and works great too. The mouse is easy to use and the mouse pad is a decent size too. The headphones work great.

My 15 year old grandson loved it!  Is telling all his friends about it.  Only thing he has trouble with is he needs to get some kind of an adapter for the headset.  He has a laptop not a tower and he can't use the headset yet.  But it does work as I have the tower.  Thank you for the great low price.  Debbie Brown,0.9520872235298157,LABEL_2

"When I first bought this product, I only used the headset eventually and haven't used the microphone attached to it.  Sound is ok in the headset, although more expensive headsets would give you a better base, like the legacy or logitech kinds.I still have not used the mouse...it's still in the original box but I'm not getting my hopes up about the quality and that's because of the quality of the keyboard, which I just decided to use today...as I write this review.This keyboard is the most plastic feeling keyboard I have ever typed with and the buttons feel kind of strange and flimsy.  Some of the buttons look a little more depressed than other buttons but maybe that's just my eyes.The lighting is cool but the problem with that is, when the lighting fails to lightup, you won't be able to see anything on the keyboard and you know the thing is going to stop lighting up in the future.  I would have rather the keyboard just have normal white print on the keys.Even now, typing this review, I find myself hitting the backspace or spacebar more because a space failed to input or a keystroke failed to input.  You really have to stroke your keys with this keyboard and because of that, you can't get really relaxed like you would a good keyboard and just let your fingers feather flow.You gotta act like your fingers have little bricks tied to them if you're going to type without hitting backspace too much on this thing.So, like I said, I don't expect too much from the mouse given how the keyboad feels and I can not speak for the microphone on the headset because I haven't used it yet but again...  The sound from the headset is ok...not the best headset sound I've ever experienced but for the money, you wouldn't argue too much.I am disapointed in the feel of this keyboard.  I feel like I'm fighting with it as I type this.I can't really speak for a gaming stand point because I don't think you really need a special keyboard, mouse, etc for gaming, you just need quality hardware.  It does have a nice ""gaming look"" tho.",0.5318113565444946,LABEL_0
"The headset isn‚Äôt bad. It‚Äôs comfortable and the sound is excellent. The only issue is the microphone on it. Due to it being short and far from your face it doesn‚Äôt always pick you up and sounds muffled when you do. In order to pick up decent voice I had to change some settings to make the mic more sensitive thus making everything in the room be heard. Still a good headset though.Keyboard look pretty sick, but it seems like it‚Äôs made pretty cheap. They keys are unique as well, some slightly variated in place as compared to a regular keyboard. One thing that bothered me because I‚Äôm OCD (but isn‚Äôt really an issue) is that everything is red on the keyboard so why is there a little blue box near the caps light? I don‚Äôt know why that bothered me so much! HahaThe mouse is great. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with the mouse at all as I had a similar one for my old gaming laptop. Also, it‚Äôs not only red lights. I think it has blue and purple too.Overall, this is for sure the thing to get if your looking to get a lot of red lights to match a red computer and not break the bank on brand name stuff. I would recommend this to someone who is a gamer and likes red, but if you plan on streaming or recording you should also invest in a microphone due to the headset sound.",0.6973721981048584,LABEL_2

Bought this for my nephew who is just getting into PC gaming. I will have to say BlueFinger surprised me with this bundle. Don't get me wrong not the best quality headphones buuuut descent.

"Honestly, I had high hopes for this product. I was excited about the color change. I even gave it a good while before writing this review so I could really give an honest review. This keyboard is not that great. It does the job: typing. As far as that, the #6 is not lit up like the rest of the key board. The right shift key is SO hard to use that you practically have to slam down hard on it just to get it to engage. The headset is almost a joke. I work online and when I have meetings, I am always met with complaints about how much background noise there is. I'm in my basement, silenced away from any noises. I started recording my meetings so that I could hear what they were talking about and it's bad. It's a constant HUM in the background. I also have noticed that you sound distant when talking, probably due to the microphone being a good 3 to 4 inches away from your face. The sound in the headset is very finicky. The headset will sometimes work with both headphones, the next it will only work with one. You have to play around with the cable to get the headset sound to reappear, only for it to disappear again shortly after. The only good thing about this purchase was the mouse. It is a really silent clicker, so I am able to do research while in meetings without disturbing the other person talking. I hate talking bad about a company and their products, but for the price I paid, I surely expect it to come in working order. No the headset does not change colors, it is a permanent red the entire time. OH and the mousepad is HUGE compared to many other pads I've had. It's about the size of a piece of printer paper. If I could, I'd get a refund or perhaps never even buy this product.",0.931830644607544,LABEL_0
This keyboard worked great for a few months them the RGB light would just turn itself off. When this happens I would have to disconnect the keyboard and reconnect it.
